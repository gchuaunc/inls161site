    <h1>Cycling and MTB</h1>
    <p>Like most kids, I learned how to ride a bike from a fairly young age. It wasn't until 2020 that I really got into cycling (just like <i>everyone else</i>).</p>
    <h2>A brief history</h2>
    <h3>The early days</h3>
    <p>Hasn't everyone used a small BMX-style bike as a kid? I did, and mine was a Next Surge. It was a really cheap Walmart bike my dad bought me and put training wheels on. (Side note: want your kid to learn how to ride a bike faster? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ff-KdrHr_M">Skip the training wheels, and try a balance bike.</a>) I had that bike for way too long, far past when I had learned to ride it for real. It wasn't until I was in the 6th or 7th grade I got rid of that bike.</p>

    <p>I finally moved on from that bike and inherited what was my Mom's bike (which she never rode), another cheap Walmart bike, a Next Power Climber 24. From years of sitting and mechanical neglect, there was <i>a lot</i> wrong with it, but I was a kid and I didn't know better. The handlebars spun, the gears didn't work, the full suspension was exhausting, and the brakes did basically nothing (side note: I almost went splat because of this). Eventually, after outgrowing this bike, I was ready to move onto another bike.</p>

    <h3>The "roadie" phase</h3>
    <p>I was done with full suspension and its exhausing nature. The two shocks, by their very nature, take away some of your power when pedaling, not to mention how poorly put together the previous bike was. I had always liked the look of road bikes with their sleek drop handlebars. My dad and I looked on OfferUp and Craigslist to see if we could find a nice road bike for cheap. Remember that this was in 2020, so the prices were out of control. Eventually, I found a bike in my budget. It was a vintage late 70s Schwinn Super Sport; a decent example of an early 10 speed road bike with 27"x1.25" wheels. I loved that bike for a year, but definitely felt the buyers remorse shortly after. $130 was WAY too much for that bike, so while prices were still inflated, I decided to sell it on.</p>

    <p>I was actually able to sell the bike for more than I bought it for, since prices had risen and the supply had not replenished by 2021. I cleaned it up and made it look very nice, removing some of the rust that made it look old and tired. I bought a GMC Denali gravel bike on OfferUp for a steal, only $80. But, it needed some work. The brakes were sticking, the chain dropped, and the shifting was nonexistent. With lots of effort and the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@parktool">Park Tool's YouTube channel</a>, my dad and I fixed that bike up to great mechanical condition and I used it for school for about a year. (Side note: didn't know General Motors made a bike? That's because they didn't! It's actually a licensed product, produced by Kent Bicycles, the same company that makes many other department store bike brands like Genesis and Razor)</p>

    <p>At the beginning of my sophomore year, I decided it was time for an upgrade. I was tired of the Denali's twist shifters and wanted something with modern dual-action levers (brakes and shifting built into one). I again searched far and wide, and found a nice 2010 Specialized Dolce Elite for $290. It was super light, shifted great, had good components (Shimano Tiagra 9 speed), and I was able to get a decent price for it. By far, it was the nicest bike I had ever used. A true road-first, road-focused bike. And I could never go back.</p>

    <h3>Back to Mountain</h3>
    <p>But there was a problem. My road-focused bike did not do so well on UNC's bumpy (and puncture-happy) brick roads. I was bouncing all over the place and risked pinchflats unless I kept the speed way down. So for the holidays in 2022, I tried something new. I bought a new-in-box, direct-to-consumer Gravity FSX 29 DLX24 from BikesDirect.com, who sells and ships bikes straight to your door.</p>

    <p>I only paid $400 for this 24-speed off-road machine. The more modern shock design played very nice and didn't take away nearly as much of my energy as my first full suspension. It had these great, strong disc brakes that worked well even in the rain, which it did at Chapel Hill. And I could go any speed I wanted in all weather conditions, bypassing the crowds using the grass, hopping curbs, and dropping down ledges. Since I had more experience turning a wrench by this point, I did tons of modifications and upgrades to the bike. To date, I have replaced the entire drivetrain with a 1x11 Deore kit, upgraded the rear shock with a lockout, changed the brakes to hydraulic, and upgraded the grips and pedals.</p>
    <p>And that's where we are today! I continue to ride with friends and family, as well as ride to destinations close to where I live.</p>
